          <h3>Honey article</h3>
          <p>
            Honey is a nutritious, healthy, and natural food, to which
            antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties have
            been attributed, mainly due to its content of phenolic compounds.
            The aim of this review is to analyze the available evidence of the
            effect of honey on humans. Forty-eight clinical trials published
            between 1985 and 2022 were analyzed, with a total of 3655 subjects.
            More beneficial effects of honey intake than no or negative effects
            on different cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, glucose
            tolerance, mucositis caused by chemo-radiotherapy, cough in children
            and wound healing, among others have been observed. Although the
            number of studies conducted to date is limited and the different
            investigations are not standardized, beneficial effects of honey
            intake have been observed, especially when its intake replaces the
            intake of other sweeteners. In addition, honey could be a safe
            adjuvant to be administered alongside drugs used for certain
            diseases.
